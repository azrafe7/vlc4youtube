# How to activate VLC's web interface
Did you know that VLC has a web interface?

Well, it does! **\o/** (..._from v2.0_)

And with it you can control the player remotely, say via a web browser, with your phone, or even from your programming language of choice.

The thing is that it's not enabled by default, but activating it is really simple.

As I said you'll need at least version 2.0 of VLC installed. Then to activate the interface follow these steps:

 **1.** open VLC

 **2.** go to `Tools->Preferences`

>   ![vlc-preferences.png](vlc-preferences.png)

 **3.** show `All` settings

>  ![vlc-show-all-settings.png](vlc-show-all-settings.png)

 **4.** select `Main interfaces` on the left, and tick the `Web` checkbox on the right

>  ![vlc-show-all-settings.png](vlc-main-interfaces.png)

**5.** **Done!**

To check that it is working just open a browser in the same computer running VLC and point it to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

You should see the web interface.


# Troubleshooting

If you get an authorization error, or are prompted for a login (as could be the case for VLC versions above 2.1), just:

 **1.** search for `lua` in VLC preferences dialog

>   ![vlc-search-lua.png](vlc-search-lua.png)

 **2.** and set a password for `Lua HTTP` there

>   ![vlc-web-interface-password.png](vlc-web-interface-password.png)

 **3.** reopen `localhost:8080` in your browser and insert the password when asked, **but remember to leave the `User Name` field blank!**

>   ![vlc-blank-user.png](vlc-blank-user.png)

VLC should be listening for incoming connections in port 8080 (restart VLC if it still doesn't work). 

On Linux, you can check this with `netstat -tnpl | grep vlc`. You should see a line similar to this one:

```
Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address           Foreign Address         State       PID/Program name
tcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:8080          0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      7958/vlc
```
